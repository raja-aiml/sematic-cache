# Go Implementation Status

This document compares the initial Go implementation with the existing Python codebase. It focuses on support for OpenAI, PostgreSQL, and `pgvector` as required in the migration plan.

## Implemented

- **Cache logic**: `go/core/cache.go` provides a concurrent in-memory cache with `Set` and `Get` methods similar to `gptcache.Cache` in Python.
- **OpenAI client**: `go/openai/client.go` implements a minimal wrapper calling the completion and embedding endpoints. Requests accept a `context.Context` for cancellation.
- **HTTP server**: `go/server/server.go` exposes `/set` and `/get` endpoints compatible with the Python server.
- **PostgreSQL storage**: `go/storage/pgstore.go` stores prompts, embeddings and answers in a table created with the `VECTOR` column type. Queries use prepared statements and connection pooling.

## Missing functionality

- **Automatic embedding extraction** like `gptcache.embedding` in Python is absent.
- **Cache manager features** such as eviction policies and vector search integration are not ported.

The Go modules therefore cover basic storage and retrieval but do not yet provide the full semantic caching workflow present in the Python version.
