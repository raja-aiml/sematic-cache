# Go Implementation Status

This document compares the initial Go implementation with the existing Python codebase. It focuses on support for OpenAI, PostgreSQL, and `pgvector` as required in the migration plan.

## Implemented

- **Cache logic**: `go/core/cache.go` provides a concurrent in-memory cache with `Set` and `Get` methods similar to `gptcache.Cache` in Python.
- **OpenAI client**: `go/openai/client.go` implements a minimal wrapper calling the completion endpoint.
- **HTTP server**: `go/server/server.go` exposes `/set` and `/get` endpoints compatible with the Python server.
- **PostgreSQL storage**: `go/storage/pgstore.go` stores prompts, embeddings and answers in a table created with the `VECTOR` column type.

## Status

All core features are now implemented:
  - In-memory LRU cache with prompt and embedding lookup
  - OpenAI client wrapper with completion and embedding APIs
  - HTTP server with `/set`, `/get`, and embedding lookup
  - PostgreSQL store with `pgvector` similarity search, prepared statements, and connection pooling
  - Observability via OpenTelemetry and Jaeger exporter

This release covers the full semantic caching workflow previously available in Python.
